Join us for the March edition of Essential Cardano360, where we bring you the latest news and updates from across the Cardano ecosystem.

This month, we dive into Cardano‚Äôs evolving governance landscape. The Intersect committee elections are underway, and Valeria Devaux and Terence McCutcheon stop by to share what this means for the community. Meanwhile, Project Catalyst continues to drive innovation, and Kriss Baird is joined by Janis Aguilar from CV VC and Chris Joannou from Draper University to discuss the impact of Fund13‚Äôs Growth & Acceleration category.

Brandon Wolf from the Lace team gives us an update on the wallet‚Äôs latest developments, from its highly anticipated mobile release to its expanding multichain capabilities. We also sit down with Josh from Late Game Crypto for this month‚Äôs community spotlight and welcome Lily Brody, the creative force behind Cardano Girls, alongside Julia Nagy, to discuss inclusivity and how we can champion more women in blockchain and tech.

And of course, no episode would be complete without showcasing some of the projects Building on Cardano. This month, Matthew Capps catches up with VyFinance and Orcfax to explore their latest progress.
