Welcome to the June edition of Essential Cardano360 - your monthly look at the people, progress, and projects shaping Cardano.

This month, we spotlight the evolving governance landscape as Intersect and the community prepare for treasury withdrawal actions going live for on-chain voting, and we preview what's in store for Rare Evo 2025 in Las Vegas.

We check in with Project Catalyst as Fund14 draws near, and take a closer look at Project Acropolis, a new modular, Rust-based node architecture designed to make Cardano more accessible and scalable.

Plus, we hear from innovators building on Cardano, including Digifarm and USDM, and celebrate a major milestone for Ouroboros Leios, now accepted at Crypto 2025.
