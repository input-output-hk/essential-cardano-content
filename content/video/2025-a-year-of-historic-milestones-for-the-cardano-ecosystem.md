The December edition of **Essential Cardano360** is here, and it’s an annual review special. As we look ahead to 2026, we’re taking a moment to reflect on the most defining moments that made 2025 a standout year for the Cardano ecosystem.

This year saw intense development, historic milestones, and the community showing up in force around the globe. Here’s a look back at the highlights you’ll find in this special edition:

*   **Decentralized Governance & Future Vision:** Relive the first full year of Voltaire governance, including the  **Plomin hard fork** and the on-chain ratification of the **Cardano Constitution**. We also recap how governance continues to mature, with discussions around the **Beyond MVG** project charting the future of governance metrics.
    
*   **World-Class Research & Engineering:** Dive into the research that underpins the protocol, including the **IOR Cardano Vision Roadmap** and the architecture redesign of **Project Acropolis**. This section also features engineering breakthroughs like the official 1.0 launch of **Hydra** and the radical transparency of the **Leios Development Tracker**.
    
*   **Community and Ecosystem Growth:** From major global events like **Token2049**, **Rare Evo**, and the inaugural **Midnight Summit**, to our monthly “Building on Cardano” slot where we meet just a few of the builders driving Cardano forward, we celebrate the community that delivered real-world utility this year.
    

Don’t miss this in-depth look at just some of the breakthroughs, key projects, and community achievements that defined the year.
