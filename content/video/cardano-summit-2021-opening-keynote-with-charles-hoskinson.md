Input Output CEO, Charles Hoskinson, opens the summit with his vision for the future of Cardano and the path to financial inclusion and empowerment for everyone, everywhere.

Cardano is built on the strongest blockchain foundations, and fuels change – for anyone, anywhere. We’ve created the platform, and in the coming years our community will use it to solve the problems the world wants to solve.
