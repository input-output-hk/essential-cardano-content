At Andamio platform, the #Cardano startup focused on bringing organizations like

FC Barcelona to Cardano, we are building and maturing the 🏗️infrastructure that leads to high-performance Learning, Collaboration, and Contribution relationships in democratic organizations like FC Barcelona, owned by thousands of members around the world, who by coming to #Cardano, will take numbers like transaction volume, number of open wallets, and overall ecosystem activity, to the next level.

With that goal in mind, we would like to share with you some details of our #Catalyst F12 proposals that will help to build and mature that infrastructure, in a global business landscape where the trend towards more democratic workplaces and organizations is growing:
