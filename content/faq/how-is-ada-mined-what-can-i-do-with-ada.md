## How is ada mined? What can I do with ada? 

Mining ada isn't possible because mining is the feature of proof-of-work blockchains. On Cardano, owners can **stake and delegate** ada to earn rewards. By delegating their stake, users help run the Cardano blockchain. All rewards are distributed in ada every 5 days.
