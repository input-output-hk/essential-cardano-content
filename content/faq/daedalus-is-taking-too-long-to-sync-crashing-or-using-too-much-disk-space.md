Daedalus is a full node Cardano wallet interface. To use Daedalus it requires you to download the whole blockchain to your computer, which us currently around 110GB. As a result Daedalus requires a lot of computer resources and it can be quite time consuming during the initial blockchain download and also every time you open Daedalus.

The main advantage of using Daedalus is so that you don't have to rely on someone else providing the correct version of the blockchain data, which is the case when using a light wallet interface. However there are now many reliable light wallet interfaces available, therefore there is no real need for everyday Cardano users to use Daedalus. You can find a list of them here:

Your wallet information is stored on the Cardano blockchain, the wallet interfaces listed in the above link are basically software interfaces that allow you to interact with your on-chain wallet. When you restore your wallet in a new wallet interface you will see your balance, staking preferences, unclaimed staking rewards, transaction history, etc.

To move to a new wallet interface you can simply install it then restore your wallet using your seed phrase, this is the list of 12, 15 or 24 words that were generated when you initially created your wallet. Please ensure that you keep your seed phrase safe and only download wallet interfaces from official links. If you are using a hardware wallet you can simply pair it to your new wallet interface. It is highly recommended to use a hardware wallet for extra security. Please see the following link for more information:
