Voltaire is here, bringing on-chain governance to Cardano. With the implementation of CIP-1694 and community-driven participation models through delegate representatives (DReps) and the constitution, governance is now active, evolving, and open to all.

Voltaire puts the full power of decision-making directly into the hands of the community. As governance tools and platforms come online, understanding why and how to participate is key to shaping the network's future.

To help you navigate this new landscape, here is a list of essential tools and platforms that make Cardano governance more transparent, easier to navigate, and inclusive. And since governance is moving fast on Cardano, we’ll keep this list updated as more arrive! Anything we’ve missed? Any corrections needed? Submit a PR below!
