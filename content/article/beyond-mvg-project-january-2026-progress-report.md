_The Beyond MVG team shares January’s progress update on the governance project_  

**Author**: The Beyond MVG team

**Summary:**

*   The Beyond MVG team is actively gathering practical input from ada holders, DReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee members, and community project leaders.
    
*   We are currently halfway to our community feedback targets and are looking for further participation to ensure broad reach.
    
*   Following the completion of initial workshops, the team is preparing for an upcoming [X Space workshop](https://luma.com/fl22k3cs) on February 18, including further sessions in the next project phase.
    

The Beyond Minimum Viable Governance (Beyond MVG) team has been hard at work gathering insights to measure Cardano's governance model. After socializing our initial governance measurement framework and metrics to gather feedback, we have moved into the active data collection phase for Milestone 2: Collect and Aggregate Governance Insights.

This stage of the project involves gathering both qualitative and quantitative data through surveys, interviews, workshops and on-chain data. We have published an updated [set of links](http://linktr.ee/BeyondMVG) where community members can access ongoing surveys and register for sessions.

## Data Collection Status

Our goal is to ensure representative community feedback across all governing roles. Based on our current snapshot, we are approximately **halfway to our targets**.

We are particularly looking to increase participation from **Constitutional Committee (CC) members, governance tooling providers, and community project leaders** to ensure the final "State of Governance" report reflects the full diversity of the ecosystem.

## Timeline of Activities

Milestone 2 of the project is due to be submitted to Intersect, the administrator, by **20 February 2026**. 

### January - February 2026

In the new year, the team's focus shifted to collecting qualitative data through:

*   **Tailored Surveys:** Developed for DReps, SPOs, and CC members to gather feedback on governance challenges and improvements.
    
*   **Workshops:** Having concluded the first series of workshops, we are now preparing for sessions in the next phase.
    
*   **Upcoming X Space:** Join us for a virtual workshop on **18th February 2026 at 16:00 UTC**. Register [here](https://luma.com/fl22k3cs).
    
*   **On-Chain Data:** We continue to aggregate on-chain governance metrics, starting from the Chang Hard Fork, to provide visualizations that correlate with community feedback.
