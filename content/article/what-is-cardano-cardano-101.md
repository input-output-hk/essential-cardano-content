What is Cardano?

The Cardano universe is expanding with the arrival of a broad range of decentralized applications and exchanges. From games to decentralized finance (DeFi), Cardano covers the whole gamut of blockchain-based versatility.

As Cardano grows, so does its reach, its community, value, and adoption. This paper reflects all that Cardano is, what it represents, and what it can offer to the world.

Founding and IOG organization

The project to create Cardano was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014. Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood founded Input Output (initially, _IOHK_) to design and implement Cardano. In addition, the Cardano Foundation was set up to oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and to act as an advocate for its users. The foundation is based in Switzerland. A third entity, Emurgo, was created to pursue commercial activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities have separate ownerships and leadership.

The Cardano blockchain and ada, its founding native cryptocurrency, was launched in 2017 and established itself as one of the leading blockchains.

IOHK has evolved into Input Output Global, Inc. (IOG) with Charles Hoskinson as Chief Executive Officer. IOG is incorporated in the state of Wyoming, USA.

The team behind Cardano

As the blockchain engineering and research company that is participating, along with the Cardano Foundation, Emurgo, and other third parties, in developing the core Cardano platform, IOG has assembled a multi-talented global team of more than 600 people. This includes computer scientists, academic researchers, software engineers, product specialists, and technical architects.

With over 600 staff (as of May 2022), IOG is an ever-expanding constellation for the development of decentralized applications, identity solutions, wallets, and an eclectic and thematically diversified range of decentralized applications for blockchain.

The Cardano blockchain

Cardano is a third generation, open source, proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Its name derives from Gerolamo Cardano, a mid-16th century Italian physician and mathematician. Third generation blockchain platforms are designed to resolve the issues that the first two generations (Bitcoin and Ethereum) suffer from, including scalability and interoperability, while fulfilling an ambitious agenda of decentralization.

The Cardano platform combines pioneering technologies based on peer-reviewed research to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and communities worldwide. Cardano is about openness, fairness, and inclusivity.

The blockchain's proof-of-stake protocol, Ouroboros, offers a scalable and energy-efficient solution to accommodate millions – and ultimately, billions – of users worldwide.

Cardano's development is led by a deliberate approach to construct a robust and reliable enterprise-grade infrastructure.

Commitment to decentralization

Decentralization is one of Cardano's main drivers, built around three central pillars:

Block production & consensus

Networking

Governance

These three elements combined form a fully decentralized environment where power shifts from monopolistic entities to the individual. Decentralization dissolves the concentration of power by enabling peers to make choices and decisions, and returning ownership of personal information where it belongs- with the users.

On March 31, 2021, Cardano's block production became fully decentralized. On that day, the stake pool operator (SPO) community began producing 100% of new blocks [https://iog.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/31/decentralization-to-d-0-day-and-beyond/.](https://iog.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/31/decentralization-to-d-0-day-and-beyond/.) This was an important milestone on the way to Cardano's ultimate destination; the creation of a platform wholly and democratically operated and controlled through a global community of SPOs, developers, and ada holders.

Technology

How does Cardano work?

The Cardano architecture features three layers:

Consensus layer

Ledger layer

Network layer

Consensus layer

This layer performs two fundamental functions:

Running the Ouroboros [https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) consensus protocol. This layer takes decisions like adopting blocks, choosing between competing chains (if there are any), and decides when to produce blocks of its own; and

Maintaining all the state that is required to make the decisions taken in the consensus layer.

Ledger layer

This layer specifies:

What the state of the ledger looks like; and

How the ledger must be updated for each new block.

The ledger layer consists exclusively of pure functions that specify the transitions between successive ledger states, as derived from the formal ledger rules, using the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) accounting model [https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/T24L95MI/file/view?key=Qcjdk4erSuUZ8jvAah59Asef.](https://api.zotero.org/groups/478201/items/T24L95MI/file/view?key=Qcjdk4erSuUZ8jvAah59Asef.) The state transitions are driven by the set of transactions contained within the Cardano blocks, and by major events such as epoch boundary transitions and hard fork combinator events.

The consensus layer does not need to know the exact nature of the ledger state, nor the contents of the blocks, apart from some header fields required to run the consensus protocol.

Network layer

This layer maintains the connections between all the distributed nodes in the Cardano network, obtains new blocks from the network as they are produced by block producing nodes, builds newly minted transactions into blocks, and transmits blocks between nodes.
