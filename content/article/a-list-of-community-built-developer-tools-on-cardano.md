SanchoNet is the testnet version of the Voltaire GovTool, allowing ada holders to register to become DReps, delegate voting power, and review and vote on governance actions.
    
*   [Summon Platform](https://summonplatform.io/): allows ada holders to submit and vote on proposals for open and transparent decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance.
    
*   [VibrantNet](https://www.vibrantnet.io/): a community integration system with Cardano Discord Bot, Hazelnet.
    
*   [Vote-supporting wallets](https://docs.sanchogov.tools/how-to-use-the-govtool/getting-started/get-a-compatible-wallet): not every Cardano wallet currently supports the ability to delegate a holder’s vote to a DRep or vote as a DRep on key governance issues. Current compatible wallets include [Lace](https://www.lace.io/), [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/), [NuFi](https://nu.fi/), and [Demos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PegeogP3pEsASFsBiRNGjXSAEJ9T51xT/view) (a clone of the Nami wallet made for the beta, available on Chromium browsers with developer mode on and 'load unpacked').
    
*   [Voteaire](https://voteaire.io/): allows everyone in the ecosystem to create a poll. All results are weighted. All proposals and votes are stored publicly on-chain.
