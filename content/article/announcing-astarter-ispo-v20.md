We’re excited to announce the launch of Astarter ISPO v2.0. This initiative offers our community a unique opportunity to accumalate AA tokens by staking ADA. Here’s why you should consider participating and how you can benefit from staking in our ISPO v2.0.

# **Why Participate in Astarter ISPO V2.0?**

## **\- Navigating the Bear Market with Smart Investments**

As ADA holders, participating in the Astarter ISPO v2.0 offers a strategic advantage especially during a bear market. By staking your ADA, not only do you secure additional rewards through AA tokens, but you also position yourself to benefit from the potential appreciation of ADA over market cycles.

## **\- Secure and Rewarding**

By delegating your ADA in the Astarter ISPO v2.0, you’re not just holding your ADA; you’re actively growing it. Your original ADA remains intact and under your control, with the added potential of accumulating AA token rewards.

Astarter ISPO participants will be able to receive priority access to Merge Staking and AWLs NFT, offering exclusive benefits and opportunities.

The more ADA you delegate, the higher the rewards. Our tiered reward system is designed to maximize your returns.

## **\- Flexible and Accessible**

You can start or stop delegation at any time. This flexibility ensures that you’re never locked in and can adjust your position according to your personal staking strategy.

# **How Does It Work?**

## **\- ADA Stake Delegation**

Delegate your ADA in the AA2 pool and earn AA tokens as rewards. The Astarter AA2 pool is being specially configured in the foreseeable future with a 99% pool margin setting to ensure that the maximum possible rewards from staking are returned as AA tokens to participants.

## **\- Tiered Reward System**

_Note: Reward table is calculated based on the annual effective rate, assuming AA tokens hold a value at $1 each, and ADA valued at $0.4 USD.  
\* Incremental AA rewards figures are based upon per 1000 ADA staked  
\*\* Annual AA rewards figures are based upon 1000 ADA staked over 73 Epochs_

# **Why Accumulate AA: A Sneak Peek at TGE and Astarter DEX (ADEX) v2.5?**

Accumulation of AA is poised to offer significant utility. We have already negotiated listings on at least three major cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs), with plans to launch when market conditions improve. This ensures immediate liquidity and potential market appreciation post-TGE.

Furthermore, the upcoming release of our DEX v2.5 version will introduce enhanced functionalities and new features immediately after the TGE, providing more value to AA holders and users. This combination of strategic exchange listings and product advancements makes accumulation of AA an opportunity to be noticed, especially as we anticipate a market upturn.
