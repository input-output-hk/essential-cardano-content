[Gimbalabs](https://gimbalabs.com/) Live Coding session, brought to you by: [Andamio](https://www.andamio.io/) by Gimbalabs.

Live Coding takes place all weds and thrus, 14:30 UTC

Ok, let's say you built a dApp, and now you want your baby to have the ability to connect to a browser wallet.

Let's do it!

1.  Go to "Connect Wallet": [https://meshjs.dev/react/ui-components#connectWallet](https://meshjs.dev/react/ui-components#connectWallet)
    
2.  Make sure that you have a browser wallet like Nami or Eternl installed. (You don't know how to do it? No worries! Go here: [https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1001](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1001))
    
3.  In the panel at the right side, click on "Connect Wallet".
    

And that's it. Easy peasy!. You can see your wallet connected to the "Connect Wallet" feature. But, the question is: How could you have this feature in your dApp?

Answer: Just copy those lines of code above the button and paste them in the code of your dApp.

But, how can I do that?

Again, no worries. Just go to: [https://plutuspbl.io/modules/201/2012](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/201/2012)Â and, if you get into trouble, come to Gimbalabs Live Coding session.
