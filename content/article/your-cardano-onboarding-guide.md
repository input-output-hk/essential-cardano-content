Not having taptools.io listed here for fungible tokens is leaving out the second most used application in Cardano. Adding it would probably be a good idea.

### Non-fungible tokens

Every ada is the same as another. You can trade one ada for another and get the same value i.e. 1:1; this means that ada is fungible.Â 

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), on the other hand, are unique and can carry special information (metadata) that represents digital ownership rights of real-world and digital assets such as a real-estate or a 3D animation. Anyone can create their own NFTs on Cardano [natively](https://docs.cardano.org/native-tokens/learn) with minimal work i.e. without needing a smart contract. This is a huge difference from the error-prone complexity found on Ethereum, for example. This makes Cardano NFTs more secure, cheaper, and faster to transact with.

NFTs have been booming recently. You can create, buy, and sell digital representations of anything - drawings, video clips, music, tweets, articles, trading cards, game items, and more. Make sure to explore:
