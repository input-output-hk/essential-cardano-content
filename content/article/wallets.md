## Wallets

Cardano boasts of a thriving and very active developer community that has created numerous hot- and cold-compatible wallets. These include:

## **Hot wallets**

Hot wallets are always connected to the internet, allowing users to easily access and transact their assets. Discover ada- and Cardano native token-compatible hot wallets below:

### **Daedalus**

[Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) is a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) desktop wallet for ada. 

Daedalus comes bundled with a full Cardano node, so it requires a relatively high-specification desktop machine for good performance. The wallet stores the entire history of the Cardano blockchain and validates all blocks and transactions for fully trustless and autonomous operation. Daedalus is ideal for those who want accurate blockchain data, but should not be the go-to wallet for everyday, minor transactions.

### **Lace**

[Lace](https://www.lace.io) is a non-custodial Cardano wallet to explore Web3. With Lace, you can manage digital assets, access non-fungible tokens (NFTs), connect to DApps and DeFi services, and [multi-staking](https://www.lace.io/blog/stake-your-ada-across-multiple-pools-with-lace-s-new-multi-delegation-feature-beta). Discover and enjoy a new world of digital experiences.
