### **Here are three ways that will help you move on to the next, and they can be decisive:**

**Mining security:**

The puzzle the miners are trying to solve serves no other purpose than securing the network.

In this way, we shorten the cryptographic key and avoid the possibility of its decryption because:

No encryption key can be used indefinitely. Its validity period should expire automatically, like permission documents, because:

*   the longer the key is used, the more likely it is to be compromised;
    
*   the longer the key is used, the greater the losses when the key is compromised;
    
*   the longer the key is used, the greater the temptation to make the necessary efforts to open it.
    

For example, revealing a key used during the day will allow reading all messages transmitted during the day; in a number of cases, the complexity of cryptanalysis is determined by the number of ciphertexts obtained as a result of encryption with one key.

This Wiranda Tech key can be infinite in time. This is an important factor of decentralization DeFi.

**Capitalization of the coin unit:**

Wiranda technology simplifies and accelerates the probability of choosing a validator. This increases the circulation speed of currency (coins) and capitalization. To select a number of delegates who manage the blockchain on behalf of their constituents, ensuring the security of the network and its consensus by their actions, we achieve a smaller number of validating nodes.

You can reduce all processes by providing transaction protocols by driving data into 3-D form. In this way, you can simplify the following processes:

*   Adjustment of rewards from block to block, taking into account many different factors. This may include.
    
*   Number of validator coins
    
*   Duration of the validator's share in staking
    
*   Total number of coins allocated for staking
    
*   Inflation rate
    
*   Other factors
    

And then a predictable reward schedule could be more attractive for users. This will cause even more market scaling.

**Transferring the function of money from the markets of goods and services and the formation of monetary value**

*   will support the commodity-money-merchandise exchange function
    
*   when using Bigdata to correlate global product and service markets.
    

It is a model of the ideal form of transaction of assets from one user to another, from the point of view of compensating the cost of future periods.

You can do the math yourself, it's not hard. It will be a very powerful fork.

And this innovative method of operating a system for making difficult decisions using artificial intelligence means can contribute to the most optimal consensus.
