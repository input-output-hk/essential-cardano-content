## Standfirst

DeltaDeFi bridges the gap between the speed of centralized platforms and the security of blockchain. By building on Cardano’s Hydra protocol, DeltaDeFi offers a near-instant trading experience.

## Summary

*   **The Launch:** DeltaDeFi successfully launched a decentralized exchange (DEX) utilizing Cardano’s Hydra scaling solution.
    
*   **The Goal:** We aim to replicate the smooth, fast trading experience of Binance while keeping assets self-custodial.
    
*   **The Tech:** Close collaboration with the Hydra team allowed us to implement efficient two-way communication channels.
    
*   **The Strategy:** We start with restricted deposits to ensure safety before we move to a fully unrestricted model.
    
*   **The Team:** Our Hong Kong-based leadership combines deep finance industry experience with Cardano ecosystem expertise.  
    

## Article

For years, cryptocurrency traders faced a dilemma: choose the high performance and instant settlement of a centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance, or the security and self-custody of a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/dex-878838c9). Historically, you could not have both.

At [DeltaDeFi](https://www.deltadefi.io/), we believe traders no longer need to accept this compromise.

We recently launched DeltaDeFi with a singular vision: to replicate the Binance trading experience directly on blockchain by combining the user experience of traditional finance with Cardano's decentralized security. This journey begins with our now live spot trading platform and serves as the foundation for a new era of [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/decentralized-finance-defi-c4b0e357).

## The Hydra advantage

Hydra is the platform's backbone, and to understand why we chose Cardano's layer 2 scalability solution, consider how Hydra handles data transfer.

Hydra boosts blockchain speed and cost efficiency by processing transactions in off-chain state channels called [Hydra Heads](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/). The DeltaDeFi DEX uses one Head. Heads are like mini-ledgers shared by small groups, allowing users to make instant, private transactions among themselves, with only the final result sent back to Cardano.​

Each Head maintains the same security and rules as the Cardano mainnet, ensuring that all transactions remain trustworthy and compatible with existing smart contracts. This system enables Cardano to support high-speed payments, games, and marketplaces – all while minimizing network congestion and fees.

## Bridging finance and tech

Our Hong Kong-based leadership team operates with an interdisciplinary design. We bring together seasoned professionals from the traditional finance industry and dedicated experts from the Cardano ecosystem.

This blend of skills allows us to understand market microstructure – how trades actually happen – and translate that into code. We understand that for a DEX to compete with a CEX, ‘good enough’ fails to meet the mark. The latency, the order matching, and the user interface must meet professional standards.

## A phased rollout for maximum security

We commit to responsible innovation. While our technology allows for high throughput, we take a measured approach to our launch.

Currently, DeltaDeFi operates with restricted deposits. We made this deliberate choice to ensure optimal operation and security stability during our initial phase. Once we verify the stability of the live environment, we will move toward our end goal: a fully unrestricted, decentralized trading environment.

## Join the DeltaDeFi ecosystem

As we expand our spot trading pairs and introduce new features, we actively look to partners and the community to help us grow the ecosystem. We invite Cardano native token projects to reach out to our team regarding listing opportunities, providing a venue where your token benefits from high-speed execution.

To further accelerate our development and infrastructure, we currently seek funding from the Cardano Treasury. We deeply appreciate the warm response the community has already shown us; your backing helps us push the boundaries of what developers can achieve on Cardano.
