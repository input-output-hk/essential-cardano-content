I see Grace as a support machine for the man and women working in the medical field and not as a companion. I would advice against taking a robot, a machine, or a AI as such because, these are tools.

On a daily basis you can observe there is a form of attachment between humans and not humans, animals and tools, and objects and buildings etc... I am not speaking against this, I am simply pointing out the fact that humanity is priority and not personal belongs. Once attached to something that is not human, people can potentially work against each other (historically proven, socially proven). No, I am not against emotions but, to work with AI and Robots, there has to be a control factor sort of say. Cold and methodical person (sometimes, this person is human), who can differentiate reality from fiction, truth from illusion, prioritize mankind and it's well being over anything.

I might be going off track here but, it is an obvious concern for obvious reasons.

Also, it would be nice to have a comment section here in this pace. Give is a devoted space to interact and just beyond to other platforms... "Apple" Job's style.
