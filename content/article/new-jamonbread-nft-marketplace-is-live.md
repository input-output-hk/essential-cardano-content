## Revenue-sharing smart contract

Introducing the first revenue-sharing smart contract in the Cardano NFT ecosystem. It's the first smart contract capable of fairly sharing the service fee revenue that marketplaces usually keep among all the parties that made the sale happen. Those parties are aggregator marketplaces utilizing their smart contract to sell or list NFTs on their own platform. The second part of the revenue sharing comes through their on-chain affiliate program - anyone can earn part of the service fee for driving sales on JamOnBread via their own unique link.

With this design, all new marketplaces have significantly lower entry barriers to the market as they don't need to develop and audit their own smart contract to start earning revenue and become competitive. Another benefit is the unification of listings and liquidity leading to a more interconnected NFT space.

This revenue-sharing mechanism will be attractive to cross-chain marketplaces wanting to tap into the Cardano NFT ecosystem too and allowing for niche (RWA, gaming, art) or collection-specific marketplaces.

## Marketplace upgrades

This recent update of JamOnBread brings a bunch of exciting enhancements. With the introduction of the on-chain affiliate program, the revenue-sharing mechanism becomes accessible for everyone within the Cardano NFT ecosystem. Users or platforms that link to JamOnBread can now link via their unique link and earn ADA by driving sales on the platform.

To find most of the listings in one place, JamOnBread marketplace aggregates listings from the largest Cardano NFT marketplace, allowing users to browse the majority of listings directly on their marketplace. Many performance upgrades were implemented to ensure a fast and smooth marketplace experience. JamOnBread has also introduced many UI/UX updates, to name a few - improved search results, on-hover action buttons, a new homepage and trending section, a new Cardano NFT market stats page, support for multiple fiat currencies, new graphs on the collection page, and many more.

To make the experience smooth for all users, the JamOnBread marketplace is now fully functional on responsive devices. Making the mobile experience complete, Vespr wallet is now supported too.

## Conclusion

JamOnBread has launched an upgraded platform, introducing groundbreaking features like revenue-sharing and an on-chain affiliate program. This signals a significant improvement in the Cardano NFT space, highlighting the team's dedication to grow the Cardano NFT space as a whole. With enhanced accessibility and a smoother user experience, JamOnBread sets the stage for exciting developments in the world of Cardano NFTs.
