**_TL;DR:_**

*   _A new chapter for Cardano governance: Beyond MVG marks the transition into regular improvements to governance, empowering ada owners to shape the blockchain’s future together._
    
*   _Focused improvements on what matters most: the roadmap directly addresses community-identified priorities, from strengthening the budget process to providing better support for DReps._
    
*   _Measurable governance metrics:  Beyond MVG creates a clear framework for tracking progress and ensuring decisions are grounded in real data._
    
*   _Collaborative and community-driven: workshops, surveys, and open discussions will ensure the roadmap evolves with input from builders, DReps, and the wider Cardano community._
    
*   _Transparent project execution: with Intersect publishing milestone reports, the Beyond MVG initiative sets Cardano on a confident trajectory of ongoing governance innovation._
    

Voltaire stands for two seemingly contradictory facts: the last chapter of Cardano's original roadmap, and a brand new start for the blockchain, in terms of community-led governance. From here on out, ada holders will collaborate, work together, and most importantly, vote to decide Cardano's future.

The **Beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG)** project is a treasury-funded initiative designed to orchestrate iterative updates to Cardano’s governance. **Beyond MVG** provides a structured approach to lay the groundwork for effective governance monitoring and critical improvements.

This article outlines the roadmap for this project, detailing the key activities, explaining how you can get involved, and exploring each major activity outlined below (open image in a new tab for better visibility).

## Continuing the governance conversation

The Beyond MVG roadmap builds on insights gathered at the two-day governance workshop held at Rare Evo 2025 in Las Vegas. During the workshop, the community identified key pain points in the governance process. Two critical areas identified for improvement were **the budget process** and the **need for better communication channels and support** for DReps. Another recurring theme was the need for **clearer documentation and communication** around all decision-making processes.

The roadmap reflects a commitment to improve the budget process and explore ways for DReps to signal their authorization for dedicated support, previously referred to as ‘executive function.’

### Improving the budget process

The Beyond MVG team will gather data and liaise with the [Cardano Budget Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee) at Intersect to validate hypotheses about how to improve the budget process. This data and the resulting conclusions will be shared with the committee to support the execution of the budget process itself.

### Supporting DReps

Beyond MVG will explore ways to better support DReps. Discussions at the Rare Evo workshop and online conversations have highlighted interest in implementing a mechanism that provides better key performance indicators (KPIs), faster analysis, and expert input to aid in their decision-making. The Beyond MVG team will continue to explore potential roles and responsibilities that DReps could delegate to other entities to gain this support.

## Laying the foundation to measure governance

The Beyond MVG project will also establish a framework for measuring governance – defining a set of objective metrics that the community can use. Once defined, the project will gather on-chain data to benchmark governance activities. This data will be combined with feedback from community surveys and workshops to create a comprehensive view of the state of governance.

### Identifying key governance improvements

Such a holistic view will enable the identification of the most relevant governance improvements and the appropriate next steps: [Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP)](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/cip-d7fcf51f), a draft governance action, or further community discussion.

## Participate in the next workshop and stay informed

Your engagement is crucial for the roadmap's success. A series of workshops, surveys, and interviews with the community will help to gather data and understand the most critical areas for improvement.

The next workshop is scheduled for October 4, live in Osaka. [Register for the event](https://luma.com/5p589eh6) today.

Regular updates and future engagement opportunities will be published on [Essential Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/), so look out for more information on the site in the coming weeks. As the project administrator, Intersect will receive and [publish all milestone reports for the project](https://treasury.sundae.fi/instances/9e65e4ed7d6fd86fc4827d2b45da6d2c601fb920e8bfd794b8ecc619?projectState=Active).
