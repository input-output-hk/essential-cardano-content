More importantly, we’ll be showcasing and celebrating just some of the hundreds of Dapp and NFT projects that are #BuildingOnCardano.

**Community celebration**

This year's Consensus event promises to be one of the largest celebrations for the decentralized world. And to kick things off, IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation will hold a [Cardano Community Event](https://iohk.link/cardano-community-event) on the evening of June 8th at the Palmer Center ([https://goo.gl/maps/V8DcqYcKVhFYmAwg9in)](https://goo.gl/maps/V8DcqYcKVhFYmAwg9in)) in Austin.

The [meetup is free to attend](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1529175571594452995?s=20&t=ej6XHH_j1TbuDa-JLYQx4g), and you will have an opportunity to meet Charles Hoskinson and connect with projects #BuildingOnCardano and community leaders.

## Free-to-attend developer workshop and hackathon

After the conclusion of the main Consensus event, IOG will hold a free workshop and hackathon for developers in Austin on June 13th. Attendees will be invited to participate in one of three tracks - Plutus Challenge, Marlowe Zero to Hero or DApp developer update track - in which they’ll be able to display their ingenuity, connect with the community and ultimately, build on Cardano. 

After the afternoon sessions, developers will also have the opportunity to network with other community members, projects building on Cardano and members of the IOG team. 

**DApp development track**

Participate in discussions with members of the IOG team and community members about DApp development. Learn about the foundations of DApp development in Cardano, the possibilities that the Vasil hard fork combinator event will open up, auditing and certification, and much more.

Later in the day, IOG will invite developers to discuss the projects they're building on Cardano.

**Plutus challenge**

Participants will use their creativity to resolve Plutus challenges issued by the IOG team. Later, IOG will offer developers the chance to present their projects to community members.

**Marlowe - Zero to hero**

This is a learn-as-you go event where participants can learn the basics of Marlowe, Cardano's domain-specific language. This track will include challenges and practical exercises.

The developer event will take place on 13th June at \[venue\]. If you’d like to attend, you can register [here](https://iogmeetups2022.co.uk/).

## Conclusion

Consensus is one of the most influential blockchain events of the year. The 2022 edition will feature relevant topics such as DeFi, NFTs, the metaverse, and much more. Consensus gathers developers, academics, policymakers, investors, and creators involved in all aspects of the push for a decentralized global ecosystem.

If you can make it to Austin, we’ll see you there. For most of you who can’t, don’t worry - we’ll be sure to keep you up to speed via our social and community channels.
