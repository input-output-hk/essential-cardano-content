🔥 Fantastic presentation, Hinson Wong, CFA! Definitely, [MeshJS](https://meshjs.dev/) is becoming an increasingly powerful 🏗 library. It would have been enough for several presentations. No doubt many of the insights from this session will be included in the MeshJS PBL ([Andamio platform instance](https://www.andamio.io/) - coming soon).
