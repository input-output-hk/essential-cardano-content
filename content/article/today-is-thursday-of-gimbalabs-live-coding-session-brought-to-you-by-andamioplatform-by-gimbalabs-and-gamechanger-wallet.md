Today is Thursday of @gimbalabs 🏕️Live Coding session, brought to you by: @AndamioPlatform by Gimbalabs and GameChanger wallet.   

Live Coding takes place all weds and thrus, 14:30 UTC   

Continuing with our section "🤸‍♀️playing, 🛤️exploring, 🥋 breaking things with Gimbalabs",  and following where we left off in yesterday's tweet ([https://twitter.com/gimbalabs/status/1699427057371918586),](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs/status/1699427057371918586),) today we are going to execute one of the fundamental moves on the way to becoming a master of Cardanian 🐉 kung fu: we are going to send a message to the blockchain, which will live forever recorded in it.  A true greeting to the blockchain Universe.  

For that purpose, and using again the fantastic GameChanger wallet, we are going to do it via "metadata". (What is metadata? read here: [https://plutuspbl.io/modules/203/2031](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/203/2031)). Ok, let’s do it!  

1.  Go to “Playground”

2.  Click “Ok”  
    
3.  Click “Demos”

4.  In the “Metadata” section, click “Hello World”

5.  In the "message" field, change the message to your own message.  Attention: "Syntax Ok" indicates that all is good to go.

And that’s it. Easy breast.  

If you click on “Advanced” you will find your message, forever stamped on the blockchain.
