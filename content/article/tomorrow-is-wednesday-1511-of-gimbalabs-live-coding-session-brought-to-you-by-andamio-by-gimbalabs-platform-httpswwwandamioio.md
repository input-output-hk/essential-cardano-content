🏕Live Coding takes place every Wednesday and Thursday, from 14:30 UTC.

From the beginning, our educational work has been defined by 4 stages:

🚣‍♀️ learn-by-doing,   
👩‍🏭 collaborate,   
🏗 contribute,  
🙋‍♀️ make decisions.

Around this methodology, very interesting things emerge, new💡ideas take shape. [Andamio platform](https://www.andamio.io/) is an example of this: [https://www.andamio.io/](https://www.andamio.io/)
