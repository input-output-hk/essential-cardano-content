# **SUMMARY PROPOSAL**

**Problem Statement:  
**The current NFT Staking solutions available for Cardano are too expensive charging projects 5,000 to 15,000 ADA per project. Examples include solutions from [CardanoLands](http://cardanolands.com/) , [Mutant Labs](https://labs.mutant-nft.com/) and [Anvil Dev Agency](http://ada-anvil.io/)

**Project Response to the Problem:**  
Enhance and existing MVP Web3 dApp that tracks **every** NFT in the users wallet and rewards Cardano native tokens with a new hybrid Web2 / Web3 business model. $5/month Subscriptions for members that give them a 25% boost in rewards. Non-Members can stake and claim for free, but without the boost.

**Project Status:**  
Expanding on what is already in place at [https://tekmirio.xyz](https://tekmirio.xyz)

**Project Team:** A team of developers lead by [Santo Electronics](http://santoelectronics.com/) (Santo Stake Pool) with marketing, software, back-end, front-end and network operations experience, all working together by sharing skills and collaborating. The team has practical and expert knowledge in Cardano, Marketing, Stake Pool Operations, Blockchain, Databases, JavaScript, Plutus & Haskell, Web2 and Web3.

**Funding Ask Amount:** 100,000 ADA

# **DETAILED PROPOSAL**

PILOT PROJECT  
The pilot project started in February 2023 thru June 2023 to provide a staking capability (v1) for Ada Hackers NFT collection and its users. [https://adahackers.com](https://adahackers.com) The team also partnered with OsmiumDAO and Rogue Primate NFT projects in this effort. Details of this pilot can be seen [https://testnetcoins.io/nft](https://testnetcoins.io/nft)

The rewards chosen for the pilot was **vADA** and **pADA** from [https://testnetcoins.io](https://testnetcoins.io). This effort gave the team great insight into the needs and demands of NFT holders as well as the requirements of the project token selected.

**MVP PROJECT**  
The team has already completed a working **MVP (minimum viable product)** of the new TekMirio NFT Staking Platform. The design goal was to make it as simple as possible and leverage the new JavaScript Development Tools from [Helios](https://www.hyperion-bt.org/) and Lucid to deploy a fully functional modern Web3 decentralized application for the Cardano blockchain. The MVP is live and can be found here [https://app.tekmirio.xyz](https://app.tekmirio.xyz)

# **Project Risks**

**Assumptions  
**All assumptions and forecasts are risky. Our forecasted assumptions are based on the small test of 78 addresses that staked their NFTs with us over 124 days. We saw about 5% of those users signup for the $5/mo subscription service. The conservative forecast above is based on capturing **5000** addresses (2024), **30,000** (2025) and **100,000** (2026). This is a reasonable assumption based on the estimated total 500,000 active Cardano addresses today and we expect this number to grow. [https://cexplorer.io/wallets](https://cexplorer.io/wallets)

**Governance**  
We see governance and the strategic decision making within the group going forward to be a risk. We will solve this in 2024 with a working DAO of Tekmirio subscribers of the new Staking Platform who will propose and vote on improvements, partnerships and new reward calculations.

**Liquidity**  
Obtaining sufficient liquidity for the reward tokens to trade efficiently on Cardano DEXs is a major risk for all staking applications and tokens.

# **The Future**

The vision statement for Tekmirio:

“**Track Digital Assets and Develop Rewards Programs**”

What we mean by this - is we want to be the leader in developing digital asset tracking solutions and rewards programs for any customer or brand that wants to leverage the decentralized power, transparency and immutability of blockchain technology. This proposal is limited to meeting our short-term goals. However, we believe our team has the skills to develop solutions that can bring substantial value to any business or brand.
