## **Court Ruling Forces Apple to Drop App Store Fee Restrictions**

In a **landmark legal decision**, Apple has been **ordered to allow external payment options**, including **crypto payments and NFT links**, on iOS. The April 30 ruling marks a major shift in Apple’s long-standing “walled garden” payment policies.

“Apple willfully violated this Court’s 2021 Injunction.”  
— Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers

*   No tracking, auditing, or approval required from Apple for external transactions.

 “This is _hugely bullish_ for mobile crypto games and NFT apps.” — @Xero, Web3 Analyst

## **Apple Quietly Updates App Store Guidelines**

## **Epic Games Responds: Fortnite May Return**

**Tim Sweeney**, CEO of Epic Games, welcomed the ruling and hinted at Fortnite’s return to iOS:
