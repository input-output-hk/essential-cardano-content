## **CIP-1694 community corkshops - the lineup**

CIP-1694 marks the first iteration of Cardano’s on-chain governance. Given this CIP’s importance, achieving broad consensus is vital as Cardano looks to the future. To make that happen, it’s incumbent that the community conducts its own governance discussions and events. Earlier this year, a [governance workshops letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F8Hj2tBO8CW1xd9ifV0OA2NFJmV8t-julWNjtCB2xYU/edit?usp=sharing) drafted by community leaders provided much food for thought about how to engage and empower the community directly.

Following on from the launch of a global workshop grant fund, Input Output Global (IOG), EMURGO and the Cardano Foundation are thrilled to announce the successful applicants to run a workshop to discuss [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/tree/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694). Over 75 quality and diverse applications from around the world were received. Submissions from North America, LATAM, and Africa made up over 80% of all applications, evidencing the strength of Cardano’s roots and interest in the future of on-chain governance.

The workshops, which will take place from May to July, will explore the latest developments in Cardano's on-chain governance proposed in CIP-1694. The in-person workshops will take place in over 20 locations worldwide, giving attendees the opportunity to network, confer, and collaborate with their local Cardano communities. On top of that, there will be over 25 virtual workshops, further opening opportunities to those who cannot attend in-person. 

Each workshop will provide inputs for technical design consideration, deliberating over questions such as; _how much should a governance action deposit be_? Or _should DReps be incentivized_? And, _what should voting thresholds be set at_? With workshops happening around the globe, all outputs will be synthesized to capture a comprehensive spectrum of feedback - moving CIP-1694 further on the path to consensus.

### **The Cardano founding entities co-hosted workshops**

The global community events will be punctuated by three workshops in Zug (Switzerland), Tokyo ( Japan) , and Edinburgh ( Scotland) during June and July, co-hosted by the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, and IOG. Edinburgh's event in July will wrap up the year's workshops and bookend the feedback loop on CIP-1694 design. Capacity will be limited given the nature of the format, however for those interested in attending Zug or Tokyo, please RSVP ([Zug](https://cardanofoundation.org/forms/cip1694-workshop-zug) or [Tokyo](https://lu.ma/CARDANO.CIP1694)). Details for the Edinburgh workshop will be announced in the coming weeks.

Once again, congratulations to the successful applicants. Thanks to everyone who applied for their interest and enthusiasm in helping shape the future of Cardano governance via CIP-1694.
