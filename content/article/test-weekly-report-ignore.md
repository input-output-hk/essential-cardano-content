### CORE TECHNOLOGY

This week, on July 3 at 20:20 UTC the **IOG teams** hard forked the Cardano testnet to Vasil functionality. You can find out more about Vasil features by going to [Cardano Testnets](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/about/testnet-introduction/).

  
The **node, ledger, and consensus** teams are now in the process of updating dependencies and working closely with SPOs and the community on testnet issue resolution. The teams released DB Sync v.13.0.0, which is compatible with the latest node v.1.35.0, and pre-released a new wallet-backend. They are also working on a new node v.1.35.1, which fixes an issue with snapshot replay.  GraphQL, Rosetta, and Cardano Testnet Explorer will be upgraded following the new node and DB Sync tags. 

  
Work is ongoing on pipelining maintainability and the addition of tests for added confidence and regression prevention. The **consensus** team also worked on the improvements of BlockFetch and ChainSync client tests and started progress on integration tests for UTXO HD with Daedalus and the Cardano node.

  
The **networking** team continued working on TCP simulations and typed-protocols reviews. The new version of the cardano-node, which includes the typed-protocol design, has been operating well. Finally, the team reviewed some exit policies and continued improving diffusion tests. 

### WALLETS AND SERVICES 

This week, the **Daedalus** team were preparing for the next Daedalus release supporting Vasil functionality. They also worked on the connection between Lace UI components and the Lace desktop version investigating ways of effective code sharing between Lace’s browser and desktop applications. 

  
If you haven’t signed up for the **Lace** lightwallet platform updates, make sure to visit the [Lace website](https://www.lace.io/). You will also find the Lace v.1.0 demo explaining how the wallet works. The roadmap includes the development of Lace desktop and mobile versions. 

  
The **Adrestia** team finished updating Adrestia components for the upcoming hard fork combinator event. The first Vasil-compatible version of cardano-wallet has been released. The team is now preparing for the release of cardano-rosetta and cardano-graphql. Finally, they are preparing the Cardano-js-sdk for production, and designing a new simple HTTP API on top of db-sync.

### SMART CONTRACTS

This week, the **Plutus** team continued refining conformance and mainnet regression tests. They also began working on a new draft of the technical report and investigated coverage and binary format tools. The team is currently updating the Plutus node dependency to create a release candidate v.1.0.0-rc1. Finally, they worked on fixing bugs in the plutus-contract emulator and documenting design decisions.

  
The **Marlowe** team added a new version to the Marlowe extended source code and a new test framework for ACTUS which works using the corresponding Marlowe contracts. The team added circa 80 new property-based tests for Marlowe semantics and improved the ‘component and modify’ modal in the Marlowe Playground. 

### BASHO (SCALING)

This week, the **Hydra** team mostly worked on upgrading the hydra-node to be fully compatible with the Babbage era (Vasil functionality). Additionally, they prepared for the upcoming release of hydra-node v.0.7.0, which will work on the hard-forked testnet.  

### GOVERNANCE

This week, **Project Catalyst** is in the quality assurance stage, where Proposal Assessors (PA’s) are taking their time to review nearly 1,000 proposals submitted in Fund9. There’s still time to participate as a PA in Fund9, if you’re interested sign up [here](https://cardano.ideascale.com).
