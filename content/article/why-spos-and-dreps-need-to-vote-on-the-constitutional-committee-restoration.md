**_DReps have elected Cardano Curia off-chain; now SPOs and DReps must ratify that result on-chain so Cardano can keep upgrading, improving, and moving forward._**

There’s an important governance vote live on-chain right now - one that determines whether Cardano can keep upgrading, approving budgets, and moving forward. It’s an Info Action, but it is _not_ a small one. Here’s the story.

## A gap in Cardano’s governance

Cardano’s governance is tripartite: delegate representatives (DReps), stake pool operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee (CC). The CC plays a crucial role. It judges the constitutionality of on-chain decisions and ratifies actions that keep the network evolving.

When the Cardano Atlantic Council unexpectedly retired mid-term in epoch 597, it left the CC below its minimum operational size. That means it cannot ratify key decisions. To fix this, an Update Committee action is now live on-chain to restore the CC to full capacity.

## What’s actually being voted on

DReps and SPOs are being asked to ratify the newly elected Constitutional Committee member: [Cardano Curia](https://x.com/cardanocuria/status/1993852745925971982?s=20) \- chosen through an off-chain DRep vote using the Ekklesia tool.

This on-chain vote:

*   Restores the CC to seven members
    
*   Ensures constitutional oversight can resume
    
*   Activates the clarified alternate-member process for future vacancies
    

Put simply: DReps have chosen their candidate. Now the network must formalise it.

## Why your vote matters

To restore the CC, we need:

*   67% approval from DReps
    
*   51% support from SPOs
    

Without those thresholds:

*   The CC cannot return to full strength
    
*   And without a full CC, Cardano’s governance machinery stalls
    

Your vote is what allows major actions to move — upgrades, budgets, parameter changes, and protocol updates all rely on CC ratification.

## The risks of not voting

If the CC remains undersized, Cardano enters a form of governance paralysis:

*   Treasury withdrawals can’t proceed
    
*   The Critical Integrations Budget cannot pass — even if DReps overwhelmingly support it
    
*   Hard forks cannot be ratified, delaying network evolution
    
*   Many categories of governance actions are blocked entirely
    

Only a small subset of actions (like Info Actions and Motions of No Confidence) can still progress. Everything else queues up behind the missing CC quorum.

Delays also risk actions expiring — meaning DReps and SPOs would need to vote again. More work for everyone, and unnecessary.

## Why this is urgent

Cardano keeps running, but it cannot adapt - and that’s not sustainable.

A full CC is required for:

*   Critical upgrades
    
*   Parameter updates
    
*   Budget and treasury approvals
    
*   Network-wide integrations
    
*   Hard forks and future transitions
    

DReps have made their choice off-chain. Now the blockchain needs that decision confirmed on-chain - before 20 December. DReps and SPOs can place their vote [here](https://adastat.net/governances/4dab331457b61b824bbc6ba4b9d9be4750e25c0b5dd42207aeb63c7431a6b70400).

_In short: Cardano can’t move forward until this seat is filled. SPOs and DReps have the power to unblock the system with a quick vote. It’s simple, it’s important, and it keeps the whole ecosystem moving. Please take a moment to vote — it genuinely makes all the difference._
