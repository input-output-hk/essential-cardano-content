With Cardano, hard forks are treated differently. Cardanoâ€™s unique Hard Fork Combinator (HFC) technology ensures the transition to a new protocol version without system interruption or restart. The protocol is able to deal both with the old rules and the new ones. After the hard fork, the new rules are used and the history of the previous blocks is fully preserved.
