Project Catalyst, launched in 2020, has rapidly evolved into the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine. It addresses real-world challenges by enabling community members to propose, vote on, and fund projects through the Cardano treasury. Catalyst is a cornerstone of Cardano’s Voltaire phase and a testament to the power of on-chain governance.
