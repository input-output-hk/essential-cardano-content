Cardano Ballot is a hybrid on/off-chain polling system created by the Cardano Foundation in collaboration with IOG that leverages the Cardano blockchain for immutable, transparent, and verifiable tallying of votes. Verifiable vote receipts are recorded on-chain. Cardano Ballot is one of the tools used in the governance process.
