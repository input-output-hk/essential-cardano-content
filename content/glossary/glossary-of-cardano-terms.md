# Key pair

A set of two keys: public verification key and private signing key. These keys are used to process and approve transactions within the blockchain.The public key is the address used as a sending or receiving address in a transaction. The private key is the secret that controls access to assets.

*   Anyone can send assets to a public key address
    
*   It is quick and easy to calculate a public key from a private key, but the reverse is infeasible with current technology
    
*   No one can withdraw assets from an address unless the transaction is signed with the correct private key.
