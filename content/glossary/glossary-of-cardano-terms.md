# EVM sidechain

[The Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) sidechain](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechain/network-details) is the first sidechain built and released by IOG, with the goal of opening Cardano up to Solidity developers. The EVM sidechain allows the Solidity developer community [to build DApps](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechain/deploy-smart-contracts/setup-development) on a lower-fees and environmentally friendly platform that consumes far less energy than proof-of-work blockchains.
