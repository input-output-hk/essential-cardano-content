The Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks, primarily designed for Bitcoin but also available for other cryptocurrencies. It enables faster and cheaper transactions by creating a network of payment channels that operate off-chain, meaning they don't need to be recorded on the blockchain until the channel is closed.

In a Lightning Network payment channel, two parties open a channel by committing some cryptocurrency to a multi-signature address. They can then conduct multiple transactions between them without having to write each one to the blockchain. These transactions are signed by both parties and updated off-chain, so they can be done nearly instantaneously and with very low fees.
