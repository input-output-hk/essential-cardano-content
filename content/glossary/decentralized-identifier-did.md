A unique identifier that is not issued or controlled by a central authority. The controller of the DID (in the case of a person, the object of the DID) can prove ownership without requiring permission from any other party.

Hello! I would like to understand how can we issue the unique identifier. And all the benefits that comes along with it. I am a authistic, asperger lady which suffer a lot with all this new tecnological advances. I am very happy and enthusiastic with Ada CardanoÂ´s beautiful token coin.

I am not a programmer, I just want to secure my money and information. It is extremely difficult and stressful to understand all wallets, store words, transfer for cold wallets...I am trying lots of wallets. For authistic people I guess this DiD seems a very safe way to secure things. In my vision today all ower data, identity number, the equivalent of social security number , adress,passport number are no longer safe, it is all there for anyone to acess. Also mobile phone number is not that secure. So in my vision the DID will make us a secure soul , little star a unique and protected person in the blockchain? Is that correct? This will protect us from malicius use of our name? Thank you, hope my question is more or less clear. And if it is correct how do we set up our DID?
