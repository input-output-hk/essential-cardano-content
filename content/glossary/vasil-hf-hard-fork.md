We all know The much-anticipated **Vasil hard fork,** but what is a _Hard fork_.

In blockchain technology, a **_hard fork_** (or hardfork) is a significant modification to a network's protocol that renders formerly invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice versa. A **_hard fork_** necessitates that all nodes or users upgrade to the most recent version of the protocol software.

Forks can be started by developers or users of the crypto community who are unsatisfied with the functionality provided by existing blockchain implementations. They might potentially be used to crowdfund new technological initiatives or cryptocurrency offers.
