An open-source permissionless blockchain platform built on the [Ouroboros](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/ouroboros) proof-of-stake protocol. Cardano was [launched in 2017](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/10/16/cardano-marks-its-launch-with-tokyo-event/) to address issues with earlier blockchains such as high energy use, limited interoperability, and scalability challenges. Cardano is being developed in five phases: [Byron](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/byron) (completed 2019), [Shelley](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/shelley) (decentralization, 2020), [Goguen](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/goguen) (smart contracts, 2021-), [Basho](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/basho) (performance improvements, 2021-), [Voltaire](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/voltaire) (treasury and governance, 2021-).
